## Separate this project into 3 sections:
1. Front end (JAVA script - JQuery)
	- detailed solution page
2. Middle part (html, flask)
	- initial page
	- "just show result"
3. Back end (python code - crypto algorithm)
	- Look into cryptosys and find the desired variables that are needed for encryption/decryption

### 10/30 F: ALL members
* Present the cryptosystems
* Clarify each module and the job of each individual
	- Xuehai & Donna : html and flask
	- Missy & Donna : Backend
		- How will it look:
			- Each cryptosystem will have it's own .py file with functions, such as step1, step2, etc.
	- John : Interactive page
* Rough Timeline:
	- RSA cryptosystem done by 11/08 Sunday
	- Diffie-Hellman key exchange & ElGamal encryption (11/18 Wed)
	- Add other cryptosystems (11/25 Wed)
	- Make sure everything works and final changes (11/29 Sun)
* Ask Prof. Young if the project is good.
* Clarify the deadline with Prof. Young.

### 11/02 M: ALL members
* Present progress:
	- John: Finished most of the framework. He presented some issues and warned us to be cautious of using ajax. 
		- For python module: We need to use a json data structure to return the inputs in the main python function of each file.
		- For the html/flask (with some help from the java module): We need to figure out cookies and ajax calling-function (double checked with Michal)
	- Xuehai: Finished the initial page with the cryptosystems and created the skeleton for all cryptosystems input pages. 
	- Missy and Donna: Will need to change the output to be a json file and also we need to have a main function in constrast to only creating a library with stepX functions. 
	
* Changes:
	- After the initial page, make a method page, and then use a botton like "try it yourself" to go to the input page (create new tab for the input page). 
	- Change backend output to a json file
* Scratch for front end design    
	- Choose a method -> show what is this method, and motivation.
	<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/page1.jpg" alt="" /></a><br/>
	- [new page] -> how encryption/ work when select encryption/decryption
	<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/page2.jpg" alt="" /></a><br/>
	- on the method page: also show how to choose input numbers for encryption
	<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/page22.jpg" alt="" /></a><br/>
	- [new tab] -> input page
		- check if numbers work |-> backend -> isPrime/
		- |-> if numbers do not work -> popup window to show which number isn't working
		- |-> if numbers work -> encryption/decryption
	<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/page3.jpg" alt="" /></a><br/>
	- [same page] -> encryption: show step-by-step with [click to see next step]
	<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/page4.jpg" alt="" /></a><br/>

### 11/09 M: ALL members
* Present Progress: 
	- Donna: Has sent motivation for RSA to Xuehai but was slow last week recoverying from wisdom teeth removal. She will send The example and method for RSA to Xuehai ASAP. 
		- Send motiation, example, and method of the cryptosystems to Xuehai by the end of the week (RSA, ElGamal, and Diffie Hellman) --> Then will go around helping with whatever has had the slowest progress. 
	- Missy: Mostly done with RSA Crypto system. 
	- John: The skeleton code is done. Will work with Xuehai to put that in the html pages and make sure it is functioning. 
	- Xuehai: Presented the webpage! Looks great! 
* What to do:
	- Group Goal: RSA & Diffie hellman to be finished by next week.
	-Donna: Send motiation, example(step by step)-method (encrypt and decrypt) of the cryptosystems to Xuehai by the end of the week (RSA, ElGamal, and Diffie Hellman) --> Then will go around helping with whatever has had the slowest progress. 
	- Missy: Fix remaining bit of RSA & Finish ElGamal.
	- Xuehai: Implement examples and method donna sends. + link user input to back end
	- John: Put everything together. Look at Xuehai's page and add ajax and javascript-interactive page into the code.
	- Have RSA linked and together by Thursday night (before our 11 am meeting on Friday).

### 11/12 U: Missy & Xuehai
* Dice game
	- Create a list of prime numbers -> let user click on generate a random prime, it will randomly select a prime number from the prime_list
	- this dice-like rule can work for primes, and other numbers
	> - example: RSA
	> 	- prime_list = [2333, 3323, ...], click on ðŸŽ² to get p, q from the list
	> 	- exponent_list = [97, 11, 7, ...], click on ðŸŽ² to get exponent e from the list
* <a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/newPage.jpg" alt="" /></a><br/>
* Backend working:
	- Error detection:
		> - if *p* is not prime â†’ return ["p is not prime"] to front end
		> - if *q* is not prime â†’ return ["q is not prime"] to front end
		> - if *e* does not work â†’ return ["p = ###", "q = ###", "e is not valid"]
	- All variables work â†’ return ["p = ###", "q = ###", "e = ###", ..., "encrypted message is: ###", ..., "decrypted message is: ###"]
* Variables limitations:
	- We are providing interactive learning systems, we don't want users wait long time (>5 seconds) to see the results, so it will be better to limit the numbers
	> - example: RSA
	>	- 10^2 â‰¤ p â‰¤ 10^10
	>	- 10^2 â‰¤ q â‰¤ 10^10
	>	- 1 â‰¤ e â‰¤ 10^3
