# Security-Cryptography Interactive Learning System

* The goal is to create an interactive learning experience for CS students studying security
* INTENDED USER: The intended user for this program is someone who is taking math458 or CIS399 next quarter! This is mostly doing the calculations that need to be done by hand, rather than generating the code. Generating code for crypto systems are different projects that the student must do themselves, independently.
  - It will have 2 main users (If anyone can think of any other ones please let me know)
    1. A student new to crypto systems looking for an interactive way to understand various cryptosystems and how to break them. For this user we will provide step by step instructions. The user will have to read step 1, do the work, and submit their result for step one. If it is incorrect, a hint will pop up on the webapp and the user can try again. If the answer is correct step 2 will pop up. (It will not go to a new page, but rather a new step will appear -- I will show this in my illustration).
    2. The more advanced user who just wants to check the end result of the cryptosystem. Thus, they dont want any hint or a step by step guide.
