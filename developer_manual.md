# Developerâ€™s Documentation:    

### A detailed developer log with progress: [meeting.md](https://github.com/missystem/crypto_learning_sys/blob/master/meeting.md)

## Overall explanation of this project:
* An interactive learning system for learning cryptosystems. 
* Help students who is learning cryptography, especially in the midst of the pandemic. 
* This web application is unique in that it uses interactive learning tools and communicates with the user at each step. 
* The user must input the correct number in each step to be able to reach the next step.

### This project is separated into 3 modules:
1. **Back-End**
	- Cryptosystem implementations
	- Creating and running the cryptosystems.
		- Each cryptosystem will return a list of string with corresponding numbers
		- These lists are different for different cryptosystems. 
		- Frontend takes output list to make interactive process
		- More info can be found in the comments of each cryptosystem.
			- [RSA Key Exchange]((https://github.com/missystem/crypto_learning_sys/blob/master/crypto_implementation/RSA.py)	
			- [Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange](https://github.com/missystem/crypto_learning_sys/blob/master/crypto_implementation/DH.py)
			- [Elgamal Public Key Cryptosystem](https://github.com/missystem/crypto_learning_sys/blob/master/crypto_implementation/Elgamal.py)

2. **Front-End** 
	- Input page and method portion
	- HTML, JavaScript, CSS for the page design. 
	- Use Flask to run backend.

3. **Middle-End** 
	- Interactive portion
	- JavaScript and JQuery calls to create an interactive module that interacts with the user.


### TESTING  
1. backend testing
	- using test file [temptest.py](https://github.com/missystem/crypto_learning_sys/blob/master/crypto_implementation/temptest.py) to run each program with different data sets
	- We tested the backend section by running the code on different large and small numbers and made sure all outputs were correct. We used edge cases and normal ones to make sure the backend is functioning correctly and without any errors.
2. frontend -- input and method
	- How did Xuehai test
3. frontend -- Interactive portion
	- How did John test
4. Outside testing
	- We had friends who are not computer scientists and have no knowledge of cryptosystems test our product and give us some feedback about the accessibility, the instructions, and how to make out product better.
